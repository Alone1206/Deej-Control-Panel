# Deej-Control-Panel
This is a control panel for deej written in Python. Supporting Both Turkish and English

ONLY TESTED ON WINDOWS 11 W/Python 3.11.7 and Arduino Nano

# How To Use Ready To Go Version

Copy all contents of Turkish or English one into a folder. And just run the CrowdDaemon_xxx_xxx.exe If you want to add or remove slider just edit the config.yaml and restart the app. Deej.exe is the original one from https://github.com/omriharel/deej. You can change it with your own version as long as it is named deej.exe

You can modify the rest of it from the source folder and compile it yourself. I use Python 3.11.7 to write the app. 

# Missing
1)Baud Change
